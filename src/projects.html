			<h2><a href="https://github.com/dannybanko/my-website" target="_blank">This Website</a></h2>
			<p>The website you are cutternly on. This project is intended for me to exercise my self taught web development skills and act as an extension to my resume. Uses HTML and CSS to build and style the website. Eventually I would like to teach myself frameworks and other web development skills and add them where applicable.</p>

			<h2><a href="https://github.com/dannybanko/SudokuSolver" target="_blank">Soduku Solver</a></h2>
			<p>This project solves Sudoku boards from different file formats using recursive backtracking. The board is represented as a 2D array, uses HashSets to check the validity, and ArrayLists to hold possible solutions.</p>

			<h2><a href="https://github.com/dannybanko/SentimentAnalysis" target="_blank">Sentiment Analysis</a></h2>
			<p>This project scans and gives reviews a positive, negative, or neutral score based on common positive and nagetive words. The project uses OOP design and implementation. Each review is read in from a file, uses a Map to keep track of the words and their occurances, a Set to keep track of all the positve/negative words, and can list the highest and lowest scoring reviews.</p>
